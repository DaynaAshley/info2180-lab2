                    Do you like panning for gold? This last winter, a team of eight rugged mountain 
                    men trekked through howling winds and blinding snow into the most remote area 
                    of Alaska. The goal: to hopefully find some gold. After two months of crushing 
                    disappointment, this group of prospectors stumbled upon the biggest find of their 
                    lives! Three weeks later, the team emerged to tell their story. In this article, 
                    I'll tell you all about it. Itâ€™s been a long journey but 16 months later we now 
                    get 250,000 pageviews to our site per month. Hard rock gold mining extracts gold 
                    encased in rock, rather than fragments in loose sediment, and produces most of 
                    the world's gold. Sometimes open-pit mining is used, such as at the Fort Knox 
                    Mine in central Alaska. Other gold mines use underground mining, where the
                    ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts.

                    Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 
                    79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally. In a 
                    pure form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and 
                    ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is
                    one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.
                    Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks,
                    in veins, and in alluvial deposits.

                    Introductions are critical to an article, but that doesn't mean you have to brainstorm
                    a new kind of lede for every article. If you build a toolkit of great openings, you can 
                    apply the right opening for the right kind of article. The Pain vs. Gain: This is an 
                    awesome opening, especially for articles that are about something you've learned through 
                    testing or experience. The introduction describes the pain, and builds empathy - gives 
                    your audience something to relate to. The Gain is promised, not revealed, so that the 
                    audience wants to read the article.  For example, if your article is about learning a 
                    valuable lesson from almost falling off a roller coaster, the introduction will fall 
                    flat if it reveals the lesson you learned.

                    A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion or informational website published on 
                    the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
                    Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post 
                    appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single
                    individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the
                    2010s, "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors and 
                    sometimes professionally edited.
